# Challenge 007: Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree

## Problem Description
Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored or transmitted. The reverse process is called deserialization. Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There are no restrictions on how your algorithm works; you just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized into a string and that this string can be deserialized back into the original tree.

## Input and Output Format
- **Input (serialize)**: The root of a binary tree.
- **Output (serialize)**: A string.
- **Input (deserialize)**: A string generated by `serialize`.
- **Output (deserialize)**: The root of the reconstructed tree.

## Constraints and Edge Cases
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range $[0, 10^4]$.
- Node values are in the range $[-1000, 1000]$.
- The tree can be empty.

## Usage Example
```python
# Tree: [1, 2, 3, null, null, 4, 5]
# Serialized: "1,2,3,None,None,4,5,None,None,None,None"
```

## Key Concepts
- **BFS / Level Order Traversal**: Allows representing the tree linearly level by level.
- **Queue**: For the reconstruction (deserialization) process.
- **Time Complexity**: $O(N)$ for both operations.
