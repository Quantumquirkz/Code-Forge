## 📜 Usage Scenario

**User**: *"Veronica, I have a big presentation in an hour and I'm feeling a bit nervous. Can you review my notes and check if I left any lights on at home?"*

**Veronica**: *"Of course, Jhuomar. I've already reviewed your slides; they look impeccable. Regarding the house, you did leave the kitchen light on, but don't worry—I've taken the liberty of turning it off for you. Take a deep breath; you're going to do wonderfully. Shall I play your favorite focus playlist while you prepare?"*
